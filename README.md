Mui5 Theme Switcher Light/Dark mode using context Api. 

Design : 
Using the context provider to provide the theme context to the Appbar component to be able to handle available modes of a theme. 
wrapping the theme logic in one file so all the theme colors and logic lives there since mui5 works a little differently than the previous version 

Target features : 
Ability to make a ready dark mode with reasonable colors in the theme.tsx file. 
Custom scrollbars for light and dark mode for windows (overrides).
